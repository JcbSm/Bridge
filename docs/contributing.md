## Branch (Optional)
Make a new branch based on the branch you wish to contribute to.

## Make your changes
Do ya thing

## Submit a Pull Request
Ensure the target branch on JcbSm/Bridge is the correct one.

## A few things...
- Try and follow coding the same coding conventions as the rest of the codebase.
- DOCUMENT YOUR CODE!!!! This includes necessary Javadoc.
- Most PRs should be made to the `dev` branch or the relevant branch for an issue. PRs to `main` will be denied unless they are updating documentation.

Happy Contributing <3
