## Branch (Optional)
Make a new branch based on the branch you wish to contribute to.

## Make your changes
- Make changes to the code. It is important to thoroughly document your code and follow the conventions present.
- For a guide on how to properly test the plugin using the build tools provided, see [this guide](./testing.md).

## Submit a Pull Request
1. Head to https://github.com/JcbSm/Bridge/pulls
2. Click "New Pull Request" and "Compare across forks"
3. Choose your fork and branch, and the branch on `JcbSm/Bridge` to merge into.
4. Add any useful/additional information & wait for approval :)

Ensure the target branch on JcbSm/Bridge is the correct one.

## A few things...
- Try and follow coding the same coding conventions as the rest of the codebase.
- DOCUMENT YOUR CODE!!!! This includes necessary Javadoc.
- Most PRs should be made to the `dev` branch or the relevant branch for an issue. PRs to `main` will be denied unless they are updating documentation.

Happy Contributing <3
